## Hi there

I'm sonyahack1, a cybersecurity enthusiast specializing in pentest and Red Team operations.

- 🔥 I solved machines and labs on various academic platforms (**Hack The Box**, **TryHackMe**, **vulnlab**, **PortSwigger** etc.) and write reports on the work I do
- 🛡️ Focused on web security, network exploitation, and system internals.
- 🚀 Constantly learning and sharing my walkthroughs.

- From time to time I will add new repositories to my profile and update the directory with writeups.
